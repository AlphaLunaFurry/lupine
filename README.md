lupine
======

Lupine IM is an experimental peer-to-peer (serverless) instant messaging client and protocol.

It is designed (on paper, as of this writing) to operate over the Internet 
(complete with NAT hole-punching) as well as over the LAN.

Project Goals
-------------

* Develop a codebase for minimal one-to-one chat
* Develop basic protocol specs
* Write a clear tutorial on using the protocol
* Split the codebase into clearly defined modules and plugins

Long Term Goals
---------------

* Create a full-featured IM client
* Add support for voice and video telephony
* Add support for large chats
* Fully document and specify protocol and library API
* Develop a Pidgin plugin
* Rewrite the entire codebase into C
* Create a daemon-only form of the lupine client for shells
* Create a form of lupine that works well with Bitlbee
* Create a TCP-compatible version of the protocol, for TOR
